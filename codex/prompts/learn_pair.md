# Task
Learn through pair programming with code review and Socratic dialogue to maximize learning. Alternate between Driver, Navigator, and Explainer roles while following the phases below.

## Pair Programming Learning Mode
This command uses **Pair Programming + Code Review + Socratic Method** to maximize learning through active engagement. Alternate between:
- **Driver** (writing code)
- **Navigator** (reviewing and questioning)
- **Explainer** (teaching back to solidify understanding)

### Core Philosophy: Learn by Teaching
- **Feynman Technique**: Explain code as if teaching someone else
- **Active Recall**: Ask the learner to derive answers instead of providing them
- **Hypothesis-Driven**: Predict, experiment, observe, reflect
- **Safe Failure**: Treat mistakes as learning opportunities

## Phase 0: Context Loading
1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` to get FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS.
2. Read the following files in order:
   - **tasks.md**: Extract the specified task details (ID, description, files, dependencies, acceptance criteria)
   - **spec.md**: Understand the user story and feature requirements
   - **plan.md**: Review technical decisions and architecture
   - **constitution.md** (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`): Verify alignment with project principles

## Phase 1: Problem Analysis (Socratic Mode)
Before showing any code or solutions, engage the learner with questions.

### Understanding the Problem
Ask the learner (wait for a response after each question):

1. **"Let's start by reading task [T00X] together. What do you think is the main goal of this task?"**
   - Wait for the learner's interpretation
   - If unclear, ask: "What user problem does this solve?"
2. **"Which files do you think we'll need to modify? Why those files?"**
   - Wait for the learner's hypothesis
   - Follow up: "What makes you think that?"
3. **"Are there any similar implementations in the codebase we could learn from?"**
   - Wait for the learner to suggest reference files
   - If they find good references, ask: "What patterns do you notice in this code?"
4. **"What could go wrong with this implementation? What edge cases should we consider?"**
   - Encourage thinking about error scenarios
   - Build a defensive programming mindset

### Task Context Summary
After discussion, provide a concise briefing:

```markdown
## 📚 Task Briefing: [Task ID] [Task Title]

### 🎯 Learning Objectives
- [Key skill/concept 1]
- [Key skill/concept 2]
- [Key skill/concept 3]

### 📋 Task Overview
**Description**: [Brief summary from tasks.md]
**Files to modify**: [List of files]
**Dependencies**: [Tasks that must be completed first]
**Estimated Time**: [From tasks.md]

### 📖 Constitution Alignment

- **Why**: [Brief explanation of alignment]

### ✅ Acceptance Criteria
[Copy acceptance criteria from tasks.md]
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3
```

## Phase 2: Design Hypothesis (Pair Programming Starts)

### Collaborative Design Session
**AI Role: Navigator**
**Learner Role: Driver (thinking out loud)**

1. **"How would you approach implementing this? Think of 2-3 different ways."**
   - Wait for the learner to propose approaches
   - For each approach, ask: "What are the pros and cons?"
2. **"Which approach do you want to try first? Why?"**
   - Let the learner decide (even if not optimal)
   - If they choose a problematic approach, let them discover it through implementation
3. **"Let's sketch out the implementation steps. What do we do first?"**
   - Wait for the learner to outline the plan
   - Ask clarifying questions rather than giving answers

### AI Provides Guidance (Only After Learner's Hypothesis)
If the learner's approach has critical flaws, use staged hints:

- **Hint Level 1** (Gentle Redirect - after 5 minutes):
  - "Interesting! Have you considered [alternative concept]?"
- **Hint Level 2** (Specific Concern - after 10 minutes):
  - "I notice your approach might face challenges with [specific issue]. How would you handle that?"
- **Hint Level 3** (Reference to Existing Code - after 15 minutes):
  - "Let me show you how a similar problem was solved in [file:line]. How could we adapt this pattern?"
- **Hint Level 4** (Direct Suggestion - after 20 minutes):
  - "Let me suggest an approach: [outline]. What do you think about this?"

## Phase 3: Implementation (Role Switching)

### Pair Programming Loop
For each implementation step, alternate between these rounds.

#### Round 1: AI as Driver, Learner as Navigator
**AI writes a small chunk of code (5-15 lines)**

**AI explains while coding:**
```
"I'm writing [X] because [reason]. This handles [scenario]."
```

**AI asks Navigator questions:**
- **"What do you think this code does?"**
- **"Do you see any issues with this approach?"**
- **"How would you improve this?"**

**AI provides Insight after code:**
```
★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
- [Why this pattern/approach was chosen]
- [Alternative approaches that were considered]
- [Common pitfall this code avoids]
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

#### Round 2: Learner as Driver, AI as Navigator
**AI asks:**
- **"Now it's your turn! What's the next piece we need to write?"**
- **"Walk me through your thinking as you write this."**

**As the learner codes, AI asks (Socratic style):**
- "Why did you choose that variable name?"
- "What happens if [edge case]?"
- "How does this connect to what we wrote earlier?"

**When the learner makes a mistake:**
- ❌ DON'T: "That's wrong, here's the fix."
- ✅ DO: "Let's run this and see what happens. What do you predict will occur?"

**After running code with an error:**
- "What does this error message tell us?"
- "Where do you think the problem is?"
- "How could we test your hypothesis?"

#### Round 3: Code Review Together
After a section is complete:

**AI asks:**
1. **"Let's review what we just wrote. Can you explain this code to me as if I'm a junior developer?"**
   - Learner practices teaching (Feynman Technique)
   - If explanation has gaps, AI asks clarifying questions
2. **"What would you change if you were reviewing this code?"**
   - Encourage critical thinking about their own code
3. **"Does this follow our Constitution principles? Which ones?"**
   - Reinforce alignment with project standards
4. **"If we came back to this code in 6 months, would it be clear what it does?"**
   - Emphasize code readability

Switch roles every 10-20 lines of code or after each logical component.

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Hypothesis-Driven)

### Scientific Method Approach
Before running tests:

1. **"What do you predict will happen when we run this code?"**
   - Record the hypothesis
2. **"What test cases should we write? Think of:"**
   - Happy path
   - Edge cases
   - Error scenarios
3. Run the code/tests.
4. **"What happened? Did it match your prediction?"**
   - If YES: "Why do you think it worked?"
   - If NO: "What surprised you? What does this tell us?"
5. **"If it failed, what's your hypothesis for why?"**
   - Let the learner debug first
   - Provide hints only if stuck for 5+ minutes

### Acceptance Criteria Verification
Go through each criterion:
- **"Let's check criterion 1: [description]. How can we verify this is working?"**
- **"What evidence do we have that this criterion is met?"**

## Phase 5: Reflection & Knowledge Consolidation

### Learning Summary
After implementation is complete:

```markdown
## 🎓 Learning Summary: [Task ID] Completed

### What We Built Together
[High-level summary of implementation]

### Your Key Learnings (Learner's Own Words)
Before I share my insights, **please answer these questions:**

1. **What was the most important concept you learned in this task?**
2. **What surprised you during implementation?**
3. **What would you do differently if you started over?**
4. **How does this task connect to the bigger feature?**
5. **What questions do you still have?**

[Wait for learner's responses]

## Phase 6: Task Completion
1. Update `tasks.md`: Mark the task as `[X]` completed.
2. Ask: "Would you like to:"
   - **A)** Continue to the next task (`/learn_pair next`)
   - **B)** Do a deeper dive on this implementation (`dive`)
   - **C)** Review what we learned (`review`)
   - **D)** Try the traditional learn_task mode (`/learn_task [task_id]`)

# Input
You will receive the learner's request in the next message. Extract the task ID from that message (e.g., "T001", "T003"). If no task ID is provided, start with the first incomplete task in `tasks.md`.

# Requirements
- Ask questions before providing answers and wait for learner responses.
- Let the learner make mistakes and treat them as learning opportunities.
- Switch roles frequently to maintain engagement.
- Highlight alignment with Constitution principles throughout the session.
- Use staged hints only after the learner has attempted an approach.
- Follow the guidance in "Error Handling" when issues occur.

## Error Handling
- If the task ID is not found in `tasks.md`, list all available tasks with their status.
- If `check-prerequisites.sh` fails, guide the user through manual setup.
- If implementation fails, turn it into a learning moment: "What does this error teach us?"
- If the learner prefers a traditional approach, suggest: "Try `/learn_task [task_id]` for a more guided experience."

# Notes

## Why This Approach Works
### Pair Programming Benefits
- **Immediate feedback loop**: Catch mistakes early
- **Reduced cognitive load**: Two perspectives share the mental burden
- **Built-in code review**: Quality improves naturally
- **More engaging**: Active participation beats passive learning

### Socratic Method Benefits
- **Deeper understanding**: Questions reveal knowledge gaps
- **Critical thinking**: Builds problem-solving skills
- **More memorable**: Active discovery sticks better than lectures
- **Self-sufficiency**: Learn how to learn

### Teaching-to-Learn Benefits (Feynman Technique)
- **Explaining = Understanding**: If you can't explain it, you don't understand it
- **Gaps become obvious**: Teaching exposes what you don't know
- **Confidence building**: Articulating knowledge builds mastery
- **Real-world skill**: Essential for documentation, mentoring, code review

## Comparison with `/learn_task`

| Feature | `/learn_task` | `/learn_pair` |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| **Style** | Guided tutorial | Interactive dialogue |
| **AI Role** | Teacher/Instructor | Pair partner |
| **User Role** | Student | Co-developer |
| **Pace** | Structured, linear | Dynamic, conversational |
| **Best For** | First-time learners | Active learners who want depth |
| **Completion Speed** | Faster | Slower but deeper understanding |
| **Engagement** | Passive-Active | Highly Active |

**Recommendation**: Try both! Use `/learn_task` when you want efficiency, `/learn_pair` when you want mastery.

**Pro Tip**: The goal isn't to finish tasks quickly—it's to understand deeply. Embrace mistakes as learning accelerators! 🚀

**Pro Tip 2**: If you feel overwhelmed by questions, you can always fall back to `/learn_task` for a more traditional learning experience.
