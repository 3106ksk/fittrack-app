# Specification Quality Checklist: Recent Workouts Display Order Bug Fix

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - The specification describes the bug fix from a user perspective:
- Focuses on "what users see" and "expected behavior"
- No mention of React, JavaScript, or specific code structures
- Business value is clear: users need chronological display for recent activity tracking

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are complete and testable:
- FR-001 through FR-006 are specific and testable
- Each requirement describes observable behavior
- No ambiguous terms or unclear scope
- Edge cases cover boundary conditions (0 workouts, 1 workout, 10+ workouts, identical timestamps)

### Success Criteria Review
✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- SC-001: "100% of the time" - binary, measurable
- SC-002: "descending chronological order" - verifiable through visual inspection
- SC-003: "reverse chronological order by time" - testable with 3+ same-day workouts
- SC-004: "10 most recently created" - countable and verifiable
- SC-005: "without scrolling to the bottom" - user experience metric, technology-independent

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS** - Feature is ready for planning:
- Two prioritized user stories (P1, P2) cover core functionality
- Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format
- Independent test criteria are defined for each story
- Scope is bounded to display order bug fix (no feature creep)

## Notes

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready to proceed to the `/speckit.plan` phase.

**Key Strengths**:
1. Clear separation between date grouping and time sorting logic
2. Well-defined edge cases that cover realistic scenarios
3. Technology-agnostic success criteria focused on user outcomes
4. Testable requirements that can be verified independently

**No Issues Found** - Specification meets all quality standards.
